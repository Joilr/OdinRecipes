    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is an iconic Italian dish consisting of a thin or thick crust topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings. It's a popular and customizable dish enjoyed worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Assorted pizza toppings (e.g., pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the preheated pizza stone if using) and bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, sprinkle with optional oregano and red pepper flakes, slice, and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
    </ol>
